# Hamiltonian-and-Euler-Path-Finder
This program is developed in C++ using the concepts of Discrete Mathematics. This program first take input of a graph and then shows the user 4 options that he wanted to determine that this graph either contains an Eular path and circuit & Hamilton path and circuit and after taking user's choice then tell the appropriate result.
